# html-div-style

**HTML div design system with 8 visual styles, Obsidian compatibility, and rendering stability rules.**

## Goal

html-div-style provides a unified design system with 8 predefined visual styles (default: Corporate Minimal) that work across standalone HTML, Obsidian markdown, and mixed environments. Includes 14 anti-break rules for Obsidian rendering and markdown readability correction principles.

## When & How to Use

Deploy when producing HTML documents, styling markdown for Obsidian, or creating documents that render consistently across platforms. Select a style (1-8); the system applies div-based design patterns, color palettes, typography, and spacing rules automatically.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Prompt | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Business report in HTML | `"Apply Corporate Minimal style to this report"` | Semantic divs→typography hierarchy→professional color palette→anti-break safeguards |
| Obsidian vault docs | `"Style documentation for Obsidian. Style 3."` | Div styling Obsidian renders cleanly→14 anti-break rules applied |
| Multi-platform document | `"Create doc that looks good in both HTML and Obsidian"` | Div-safe markdown→HTML styling + Obsidian syntax→readability correction |

## Key Features
